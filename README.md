<h2>The Bones WP</h2>

<h6>This is a custom starter kit for wordpress projects. It's based on <a href="https://github.com/stefanerickson/wp-multivitamin">WP Multivitamin</a>, and makes life 1000% easier for creating wordpress websites. It takes the guesswork out of template hierarchy, which can be confusing. The Bones WP utilizes Sass for the fancy stuff, Bourbon/Neat for the heavy stuff, Grunt for the tedious stuff and more.</h6>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h6>Install this like you would any other Wordpress Theme. Drop it into your 'themes' directory and activate it through the dashboard.</h6>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h6>There is a small learning curve with this starter kit. I hesitate to call this a 'theme' because it's so much more than that. Below is a brief index of how you do the things you want to do.</h6>
