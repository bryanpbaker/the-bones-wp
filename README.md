<h2>The Bones WP</h2>

<h6>This is a custom starter kit for wordpress projects. It's based on <a href="https://github.com/stefanerickson/wp-multivitamin" target="_blank">WP Multivitamin</a>, and makes life 1000% easier for creating wordpress websites. It takes the guesswork out of template hierarchy, which can be confusing. The Bones WP utilizes Sass for the fancy stuff, Bourbon/Neat for the heavy stuff, Grunt for the tedious stuff and more.</h6>

<h3>Installation</h3>
